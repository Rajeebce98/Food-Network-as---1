                <h4><b>Wagyu Beef</b></h4>
                <p>agyu is different from other types of beef. Wagyu beef is distinctive because it is highly marbled.
                    Marbling refers to the visible layers of intramuscular fat. This is fat that is found in the muscle.
                    Due to the unique genetics of the cows, the meat contains a higher percentage of fatty acids than
                    ordinary beef, giving it a higher marbling score. </p>
